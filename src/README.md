## 🔐 Auth0 Configuration

Before running the app, you need to configure an Auth0 application.

### ✅ Create Application in Auth0

1. Log in to [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).
2. Go to **Applications → Applications**.
3. Click **"Create Application"**.
4. Name it (e.g., `React SPA`) and select **Single Page Web Applications**.
5. Click **Create**.

### 🔧 Update Application Settings

Under the "Settings" tab of your new application, configure the following:

- **Allowed Callback URLs**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```
- **Allowed Logout URLs**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```
- **Allowed Web Origins**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```

Save changes.

## ⚙️ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add:

```env
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
```

You can find these values in your Auth0 application's "Settings" page.

## 🏃 Running the App Locally

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🔁 Features

- Login/Logout via Auth0 Universal Login
- Social login support (e.g., Google, GitHub)
- Display authenticated user's name/email
- React Router ready
- Auth0 error handling
- Optional account linking (advanced)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure `http://localhost:3000` is in the allowed origins in Auth0.
- For silent authentication to work in production, your app **must** be served over HTTPS.
- Refresh tokens are disabled on `localhost` to avoid browser security errors.
